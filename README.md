# to-do-list
this is a to-do list manager created by me!

Simple to use.

First the user will add a task. The task then gets added to an ordered list. The user can check off items on the list after they have been finished. 
The user is able to make changes to the item after it's been added to the list. The user can also delete items off the list.
